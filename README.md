# Spider_Classifier
Using fastAi to detect common spiders in Kentucky

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/chris-kehl/Spider_Classifier/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fspider_classifier_app.ipynb)

This repository consists of python notebooks used to build an image recognition application with the fastai framework to classify spiders that are native to Kentucky.

All the instructions are published on medium in a four part series and starts with this first series https://medium.com/geekculture/building-a-state-of-the-art-fastai-app-to-identify-the-strange-and-dangerous-spiders-of-kentucky-4817183ef604.

* Part I gathers the necessary data files
* Part II builds the baseline model
* part III experiments with resnet152 and fine-tunes the hyperparameters
* Part V builds an application that can be viewed on any device with binder, (link is the binder button above).
* Future research will be ongoing to publish this classifier as an iphone app

# Spider_Classifier
Using fastAi to detect common spiders in Kentucky

[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/chris-kehl/Spider_Classifier/HEAD?urlpath=%2Fvoila%2Frender%2Fspider_classifier_app.ipynb)

This repository consists of python notebooks used to build an image recognition application with the fastai framework to classify spiders that are native to Kentucky.

All the instructions are published on medium in a four part series and starts with this first series https://medium.com/geekculture/building-a-state-of-the-art-fastai-app-to-identify-the-strange-and-dangerous-spiders-of-kentucky-4817183ef604.

Part I gathers the necessary data files
Part II builds the baseline model
part III experiments with resnet152 and fine-tunes the hyperparameters
Part V builds an application that can be viewed on any device with binder.
future research will be ongoing to publish this classifier as an iphone app
